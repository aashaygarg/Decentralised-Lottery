2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

## Structure

* basic setup using brownie
* main structures of the code: start, enter, end, and deliver the results and paying the lottery winner using Openzeppelin and Chainlink
* Ensuring randomness using Chainlink VRF, ensuring oracle gas and transaction gas, following the request-receive architecture
* Ensuring unit tests and integration tests of the application
* Understanding and implementing events and callbacks
* Deploying application on Rinkeby and local computer
